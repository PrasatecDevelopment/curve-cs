# Curve Engine
The Curve Engine is the first uploaded open source project from Prasatec Development. The intent of uploading and sharing this project as open source is three part:

1. We want to recieve constructive criticizm for our coding techniques and methodologies. We have several project ideas on hold due to time constraints, and continuing to work full time jobs, and don't want to waste our time with unneccesary or redundant code. If you notice anything in these code files that could be simplified, or seems like a ridiculous or overly-complex way of performing the function, let us know.

2. Being a free software library, we feel that our future projects, as well as anyone else who decides to use this library, will benefit from community contributions and modifications.

3. We hope to find a way to contribute to the open source community. While, in all honesty, not all products we will release in the future will be open source, we do want to find a healthy balance between proprietary and closed source so that we can help the community, protect our trademarks and protect confidential information entered into our products from our end users.
